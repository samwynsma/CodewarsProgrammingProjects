# CodewarsProgrammingProjects
This repository is for reading only. Do not copy this repository for usage on Codewars problems. That would be cheating.

For those who are not familiar with Codewars, it is an open-source website for programmers to practice their coding abilities.
Problems are difficulty rated from 8 to 1, with lower numbers being harder problems.
Anyone can make a problem on codewars, but only those that get a high approval rating from the community get published.
This website has more practical problems than other websites, which I like more. Many of the questions asked involve things that anyday people might do.
